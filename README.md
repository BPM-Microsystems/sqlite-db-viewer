# SQLite Database Viewer

This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing the contents of the SQLite database generated by the BPWin application. The database (typically `continental_data.db`) contains a table named `ContiData` that stores continental serialization data. The viewer is read-only and displays data.

## Features

- **Read-Only Access:**  
  Opens the SQLite database in read-only mode to ensure data is not modified.
  
- **Dynamic Column Detection:**  
  Automatically retrieves column names from the table schema, so any schema changes are reflected immediately.

- **GUI Display with Scrollbars:**  
  Uses Tkinterâ€™s Treeview widget to display data, with both vertical and horizontal scrollbars for full navigation.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included with standard Python distributions)
- SQLite3 (built-in module)

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Database File:**  
   Ensure that the generated SQLite database file (e.g., `continental_data.db`) is in the same directory as `db_viewer.py` or update the `db_path` in the script accordingly.

2. **Run the Application:**  
   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `db_viewer.py`, and run:
   ```bash
   python db_viewer.py
